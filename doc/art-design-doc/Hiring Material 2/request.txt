Rework
	- mine_spare_partsv2.png. Really love the look. But I can't get the shading right to work with the rest of the game. Some details are a bit strange too. Should most definitly look like a circuit board.
	- Power Amplifier. Is it possible to make something that look like the Quad-Damage in Quake but fit with the rest of the game ? I hate the one I tried to make.
