RELEASE CHECKLIST :::
- Check player starting inventory
- levelLoader.gd => test_mid_game is false
- compilation set to release (debug unchecked)
- save after each turn, save when quit

TODO :::
- touch-scroll lists ?
- Add random derelic you can pickup items from
	- when trying to pickup derelic should warn player : "not empty" (see final converter of yendor)
- recipe row size != inventory row size
- Converter recipe list has heigher rows than other lists
- investigate steam and itch.io
- ***BUG: still issues when switching ship with ultimate scanner... memory is not created, ships turn invisible, etc.
- why do I keep mixing up inventory and converter ?
- Issue with yield() while loading on my tablet... loading takes hours
	- perf : iterating over all tiles while loading might be a bit much ?
- Mobile only "features" ?
	- Hide "Quit" button (iOS or Mobile in general)
- Tutorial
	- grab & conv where highlighted together then when I clicked conv it became gray (null _old_style ?)
- art
	- converter ?
- translation
	- Godot : Implement Localization
		- You can link CSVs in localization, replace certain resources (like textures) with others and even change the project name based on choosen locale
		- CSVs file are automatically converted into localization files
			- use tr() method to get translation from keyboard
			- button labels and such automatically check if text is a key and translate
			- for format godot support stuff like "bleh {id}".format({"id":"hello world"})\
- Generate icons, banner, etc. for android/ios/pc release
- customize scroll bar visual ?
- death screen need beautification
- leaderboard display improvement (scroll is not ideal yet)
- BUG: craft scout, transfer all, notice scout disapear from screen, put back scanner and scout comes back to live (ultimate scanner).
- SOUNDS
	- SFX :
		- no sound when transfering cargo (but mount is ok)
		- revisit moving noise
		- Use nanobots
	- music
		- Credit / success screen
		
- Achievements
- Android tests :
	- Ask my father to install
	- Ask mom to install phone + tablet (take screenshot of font size on HHHDPI phone/tablet)
	- Install on aya's phone
	- Try Clara's phone ?
- review multi-tile objects
	- Collision on each tile but behave as a single entity ?

	
	
	
polish :::
	- Pinch-Zoom tuto ?
- Basic interaction
	- Look around
		- select item using keyboard
	- Shoot
		- select target using keyboard
- Spawning
- BUG: Any random interaction should cancel targetting ? (CNR)
- BUG: moving while targetting will cancel overlay but won't push back HUD (CNR)
- make sure player cannot generate more energy than max capacity
SOUNDS:
	SFX:
		- Beeping for white, yellow and red log messages
		- different noise for each category of drop ?
		- Noise for transfer from ship to ship (or same as equip ?)
		- autopilot interupted ?
	MUSIC:
		- change music when aggressive ennemy hunting ?
- level generation improvement :
	- revisit spawn chance... could I specify it in chance per level instead of per tile ? would make tweaking level design easier (1 per level is a chance of 0,00015625 !)
	- Sokoban example : might want to spawn wormhole #1 OR #2.. not both, but definitly at least 1
	- Nethack : Quest level different by race (I don't have race for now ?)
	- Dependency ? Castle can spawn between 25-29 but never before medusa
- Don't potion if not needed !
- going down wormhole should take ap and/or energy
- Border around level is ugly
	- give it a "danger" kind a texture ?
	- remove it and warn the player : "cannot get out of sun's gravity well"
	- ???
- add icon in material list in crafting diag
- categories in crafting material list (when more than 4-5 items)
- a way to id player ship when scrolling the map around
	- button to re-center ?
	- feedback when in 'goto' mode ?
	- little arrow showing the player <-- The Ombarus
- "grab" menu when multiple objects ?
- crash trying to convert 10 missile to energy (CNR)
- Interupt crafting if shot ?
- don't let planet material spawn under the player
- OPTIM : loading json cache
- OPTIM : scanner
	- AI are only interested in player so don't check all surrounding
	- Can not check empty tile to avoid 80x80 tile check with the ultimate scanner ?
- PERF: Render on Tablet is slow. Even main menu I only get ~20fps... in-game I max at 17, 6-7 while moving...
		- Perf issues on my tablet
			- Text UI take too long to render (1 draw call per char!)
			- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11797
			- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/19917
		- Update scanner is slow.
		- Could maybe update a bit less AI each frame
		- Mostly seems to be rendering is pretty slow... Not sure what is slow, not so many textures, maybe I can improve the shaders ? Could it be the text again ? Overdraw ?
- PERF: optimize lists. Seems like if you have 20-30 items in the transfer window there can be quite a delay to load and/or update the list
	- Do not regen the whole list every time something change
	- When generating the whole list... do it in a thread ? (or 4-5 per frame ?)
- Work on Anomalies and status effect
	- haste
	- poison
	- disable weapon ?
	- disable converter ?
	- EMP shock empty shields
	- teleport
	- explosion (damage)
	- Nanites trap (heal ?)
	- Aggravate (monster come to last known location ?)
	- Confusion (ship moves in random direction ?)
	- Naked Singularity (constrict ship, prevent movement until ship can escape it's pull (damage per turn ?))
	- Complete shutdown (unable to act for X turn)
- ***BUG: if disabled is in the base_attributes we cannot override it in modified_attributes !***
- New movement (always goto) prevent going on top of something if you can interact with it :/
- Allow clicking outside of the map to move (it has weird behavior now with contextual clicks)
- Spawned on top of sun. Wormhole looks weird
- equilize sounds to similar db
- Tuto :
	- steps :
		- If player has Missile Launcher and 0 missile... trigger converter missile crafting tuto
		- wormhole
	- Tuto Skip Prompt
- wormhole shader spiral is weird when not at 1:1 zoom
- Goto on tablet... to help with accuracy. Highlight the cell on tap and move on release ?
- anomalies should be more than 1x1 tiles ?
- UI animation
	- animate health and shield when hit
	- animate energy when lost or low
	- animate crafting ?
- Multiple save slot for different runs ?
- Improve, beautify and add stuff to settings
	- language
	- sound volumes
	- resolution (PC only ?)
	- vsync (PC only ?)
	- key bindings (PC only ?)
- dialog cancel button doesn't fit well
- more dynamic Camera ? (shakes when hit, smooth movement, smooth zoom, etc.)
- Transfer UI should display player's ship name (crafted ship could have a 1, 2, 3, 4... appended ?)
-- (suggestion) from Destragon on youtube : Mousing over things should automatically display the description in the text box at the bottom without requiring you to press l for look.
- welcome screen presentation is lacking (bunch of colors, line length mismatch, italic, bold, underline... need better design)
- Highlight last run in leaderboard in main menu
- Sort energy recycler need list from most energy to less energy
- Loot interface :
	- when drag & dropping.. highlight mount slot that fit with the object being draged
- Generic system to show/hide button based on player inv/equippement
- Cache JSONs when loaded 
	- so I stop getting it from disk everytime I need the attributes of an equiped object,
	- base_attributes could also be changed to point to the cached data to avoid duplication
- When dead FTL button stays invisible ?
- Drag-cancel as % of screen resolution
- smooth camera (a la township?)
	- smooth zoom limits & exponential zoom
	- drag still remember even tough camera doesn't pass limit
- Read-Only base_attributes to prevent un-savable changes by mistake
- re-work Object identification (show as unknown, then remember id-ed stuff)
- Improve AI to work with Torpedo (try to avoid shooting allies. Allies can take damage, etc.)
	
		
IDEAS:::
- If you try to produce energy over the maximum of the ship capacity there is a chance you "choke" (engine goes critical and blow up)
	
	
DONE :::
- Main Menu music
- Message if you try to go up the home wormhole
	- beside displaying the intro msg... add a warning log : "can't open wormhole right now, find something that can"
- "enemy", pas "ennemy"
- BUG: Global max seem broken. More than one of the same branch wormhole sometimes spawn (should be fixed... src had res:// in)
- Check what ressources are used and exported to reduce package size
- wait shortcut says 5 but doesn't work
- zoom out now sometimes pan in a weird way
- Zoom button should keep zooming on pressed
- scrollwheel should zoom toward mouse
- apply planet explosion to other planets (right now just planet_a)
- **BUG** tap (or click) sometime move the camera around
	- seems to happen when you click while we're smoothing the pan after a drag.
- tap on the screen should cancel autopilot
- **BUG** equipping an mk2 scanner hides the wormhole to a '?'
- **BUG** transfer doesn't set name of ship
- **BUG** fullscreen doesn't work
- HitFX & SFX for planets
- Still issues with "detected" objects. If we blow up a planet, the "food" will be considered never seen until we move then it interup the move
- difficulty (for youtuber like spacegamejunkie.... this is too tough right now)
- Difficulty
	- add drop-down to name selection on new game
- wormhole show '?' when out of mk2 range
- Settings improvements ?
	- remap keys ?
	- vsync, resolution, windowed, etc ?
	- give a base-rate bonus on easier diff
	- increase planet inventory on easier diff
	- save in the player the "lowest" difficulty the player set. Then write it in the leaderboard.
	- Give a big points bonus for higher diff
- leaderboard doesn't have scroll bar ?
	- Find a way to prevent multiple tuto at the same time (issue with tuto prompt pushing on top of each others)
	- Auto-size tuto prompt
- Dropping torpedo dropped missile ?!?
- get rid of normal map ref in sprites
	- Menu option to re-enable Tuto
	- Tuto Prompt
	- Tuto Behavior
- missing missile icon in transfer window
- Some way to differenciate my ship from others.
- Outline :
	- Fix desaturation on Wormholes ?
	- Remove outline on ghost
	- boardable ship outlined in white ?
	- test boardable ship
	- fix desaturation with new layout of ships
- Make the planets spin on themselves
	- Would have to change planet design... they would need to be seen from "top". Deformation from rotation looks strange, Also planet with moons or rings would need to be split into multiple parts.
- managed to drop and pickup object in same frame resulting in a crash (from inventory window drop an item with a sort of double-click)
	- Also, Unhandled_input is getting called even tough I have a full screen control stopping inputs... why ? (related to drag&drop ?)
	- ****BUG*** rare crash when drag-dropping stuff from inventory to ground where it tries to pickup the item we're currently dropping and it hasn't been added to world yet so it crash in get_parent()
	- (I put a "get_tree().set_input_as_handled()" in the drag-and-drop call... should fix the issue)
		- xReplace flagdrop with something NOT CC3 ? or I have to add link to license, state if I did any changes, etc. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
		- xReplace 270343__littlerobotsoundfactory__shoot-01-freesound-cc3.wav with something NOT CC3 ?
		- xhull hit
		- xshield hit
		- xMoving swoosh ?
		- xengine noise when zoomed in close (2d for when panning the camera)
		- xWormhole warp
		- xAlert when low energy
		- xAlert when low hull
		- xCrafting noise for converter
		- xEquip noise for mounting
		- xShooting Noise (Laser, Missile)
		- xBoom for destruction
- Launch weapon effects with a slight offset from center so we can see multiple simultaneous shots
- object with ghost unless they're agressive should not stop goto
hull hit, shield hit, 
- BUG: can't fire multiple weapon if we select a target out of range (works if we select empty tiles) (I *think* this is fixed?)
- Go back and fix & add all missing shortcuts for all buttons in the UI
	- Issues in main menu (esc doesn't work ?
	- Investigate music style and artists that could do something nice
		- maybe should have a few different music (do something with music when health is low or ennemy is close, etc ?)
			- Star Ocean First Departure
			- Disgaea ?
			- Final IX battle theme ?
		- Button hover, click
	- Investigate how to trigger basic sounds (buttons, shooting, explosions)
		- AudioStreamPlayer (base, 2d, 3d). Works with Wav (sfx) or Ogg (music/dialog)
	- Find free sounds I could use for now
	- slow
	- disable scanner (blind)
	- Energy vortex (lose energy) (% to avoid killing player ? but this can suck if you had 100000 energy and lose 50 000)
	- Anomalies should have a chance to be detected (based on scanner level ?)
- order categories in inventory/transfer (weapon, shield, scanner, converter, utility, cargo ?)
- Crafting utilities require 2 utility but if you have at least one it won't say you are missing another one
- ****BUG*** : clicking outside the world (but on the ship) sends the ship in random location
	- have the spawn chance be able to have group of related elements (so I can spawn for example, 3 missiles next to each other 0.1% chance per level)
		- make for more story like spawns like a missile launcher and 2-3 missile and maybe a broken down prop next to each other but relative position instead of absolute like the sun
- Still can get shot before autopilot stop... why ?
- warp effect when travelling in wormhole (should also be how the game launch when you hit "new game")
- Craft button should be grayed if not enough energy (right now does nothing when clicked)
- can't craft solar array because require 2 utility but they don't stack
- ***BUG*** : again autopilot didn't stop when I was getting shot...
- Diluted crystal icon is pretty small
- ? when transfering cargo from hull relic gives description of hull instead of selected item
- drag-drop item from inventory to ground drop all amplifier in one shot ? CNR (might be fixed with transfer all ?)
- doing a transfer all I lost one of two equiped solar array ! 
- if wormhole.base_attributes != Globals.LevelLoaderRef.GetCurrentLevelData(): doesn't work ! I'm never going home T_T
- With new movement anim, the log about what is under your ship is delayed ?
- ***BUG*** : when changing level camera should teleport
- ***BUG*** : interaction button is late by 1 move
- New camera tapping on the screen moves the camera weirdly
	- improve camera follow smooth
- Animate displacement a bit
	- round up position to grid size to avoid floating point error working with anims
	- make ai ship animate all at the same time
- when transfering content... can't drag on cargo items to drop into cargo holds
- ***CRASH: Tried to craft a battleship from a frigate and transfer all. Crashed in do_anomaly_detection (because we tried to do anomaly detection even without a scanner)
	- var scanner_data = _node_id_scanner[obj.get_attrib("unique_id")] (_node_id_scanner doesn't contain frigate unique_id anymore)
- Bind "return" key for "ok" btn
- Tweak: Should be able to hold hulls for crafting scout in scout (at least if drop everything)
- Save node's rotation (position is saved but not rot)
- fix max cargo. make sure we're never above cargo capacity
	- check if we always update current cargo volume
- Tweak: Probe doesn't have enough cargo space to hold any hulls for crafting which means we can be stuck in a probe forever ? (you can pickup anything now... just won't be able to move)
- clean name (always return the id with or without "res:")
- Refactor equip mount dialog with similar drag&drop instead of two annoying separate popup
- transfer drag&drop dialog. Should ask for how many of a stack to transfer
- BUG: the "ok" buton can trigger multiple windows (like how many dialog 'ok' and the close converter 'ok')
- BUG: scaling UI issues on android ? 
	- (seem to be a text_width issue with font oversampling)
	- Hopefully it can should be fixed ? only happen with my mono custom font,
	- doesn't happen with godot's default font (maybe because it's not oversampling ?)
	- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/22580#issue-365322210
- Look button should popup a window with details ?
	- How to handle multiple item on same tile ? (back and forth button in the dialog ?)
- should display # of turn when crafting
quit show player name popup, [n] doesn't work ?)
	- [esc] in main HUD should pop setting diag ?
- Background for bottom_title ship name in status bar
- bottom line of dialog over cancel button doesn't disapear anymore
- No Wait button for mobile (with contextual click it can be tricky to click on yourself)
- Button size and spacing is uneven
	- Windowed, resolution
- black text stay stuck when switching between mounts and cargo in inventory dialog
- BUG: Loading level doesn't load the same planet sprite ? (because it's random choice ?)
- Polish Energy "Recyling" informations in crafting UI
- Block background in the howmany dialog
- Find a way to show how many of something you already have when crafting
- Try to figure out a way the player can see attributes for any objects easily (from any dialogs or HUD) (there's a description ? button nearly everywhere now)
	- Move all cargo button shouldn't affect mounts, there should be a move all mounts button that moves only mounts that fit free spots
- block button shortcuts when dialog is open
- Change FTL button to say > or < depending on wormhole data
- Crafting interface
	- Automatically check item necessary for recipe (if possible)
	- Mark missing item in red in description
- Scan
		- Give health remaining on ships
		- Give detailed description of planet (rich but hard to mine, poor but easy to mine, etc)
- description if field is null do not display or display (N/A, No Data ?)
- destroyable.hull should be destroyable.current_hull
- BUG: still have negative inventory sometimes
- missile icon gone from recipe menu
- fog too subtil
- planet icons not set (for multiple-target dialog)
- drag & drop to mount from inventory window
- can't see red line of targetting HUD when zoomed out
- Log window text not window size
- UI is slightly off on android since update to 3.1 (probably because of native resolution vs stretch settings in project ?)
- Broke green background in converter
- Can't go fullscreen with the game options (need to trigger it manually in the code)

- Fix Shortcut in the MainMenu... I wish I could have the UIManager in MainMenu... is it possible ?
- hitting shortcut 'c' while in crafting double-pop the craft window and disable it ! (fixed by new shortcut manager)
- include energy used by idle turn in crafting total energy cost
- Transfering ship & ship item should take AP
- Review the fact that crafting takes time so producing energy takes energy = to idle amount...
- transfer window cargo capacity start at -140 ?
- ghost of planets are always the same instead of being themselves ? (because the sprite is randomized ?)
- Delete old inventory, old transfer, old mount and all btn and reference to them in code and git
- new Inventory UI doesn't display remaining cargo
- "mount where" in inventory shouldn't display if there's only one possible mount position
- Refine Need/Using list in converter UI (maybe a title + some outline for the list?)


- Contextual click : if there's an object on a planet... don't attack planet ?
- Equip jerg converter crash game (CNR)
- Title doesn't update in weapon HUD
- Drag & drop in inventory crashes game
- cancel targetting on key pressed on pc
- Put the name of the weapon in targetting overlay (also put something more clear with boarding and transfering)
- Make a late-game level and test late-game balancing (debug switch in levelloader)
- BUG: Can pickup converter of yendor battleship hull and lose converterg
- BUG: Swapping gravitic compactor didn't reset my cargo space

- Change name of FTL button
- Change status bar name with actual ship name
- Add question mark in lower-right corner as a sort of "tutorial"


- BUG: ship spawned from planetary defence wait 3-4 turns before moving

- human frigate don't play their explosion
- BUGBUGBUG: something weird happens if I try to install a cargo compressor next to solar array


- Limit leaderboard to top 100
- update player name and z_index when changing ship
- fixed crash when calculating score if no converter installed
- Scanner pickups up wormhole on first turn after going up/down when trying auto-pilot
	(was issues with scanner being updated in _process() but go-to happen in  event called by _process() from AP Behavior which is before everything else)
- Make sure player ship is on top of everything
	(also added preference, sun is below everything, ennemy ships above everything but player, etc.)


- Update Converter recipes with mk2-3, etc.
- BUG: "take all" in transfer window would duplicate items if multiple mounts of same type
- Cleaned up converter mk2 and yendor (not sure of balance)
- BUG: Can transfer cargo from ennemy ships
	- What are the conditions if not for having cargo component ?
		(Added transferable attribute to cargo)
- contextual click should have priority :
	1. attack ennemy ship, not planet and especially not boardable ship (check distance)
	2. pickup anything lying around
	3. attack planet
	4. transfer items (check distance)
	5. attack anything attackable ?
- BUG: Contextual touch only if object is visible !



- Finally removed all "inspired" sprites, sun and planets are my own invention now
- Revamped space background to be more subtle
- BUG: switching ship reset ghosts ? (mk2 scanner replaced everything with ? even ghosts I had already seen)
- Cancelling autopilot without moving still takes 1 turn (like if ennemy is too close to trigger autopilot)
- try to improve font rendering speed by replacing bbcode with regular labels (2fps gain on my tablet)
- various crashes fix (by checking for null mostly)


- Don't drop item when equipping new one, send to cargo
- Swapping scanners would sometime cause crash and/or weird bugs (especially with ultimate scanner)
- BUG: Going up a wormhole I got an NULL objById 417 when trying to update the scanner
	- (I think this was because ObjByID sets ids to null when removing ghosts but sometime in the same loop where we reference the ghost)
- Fixed ultimate_scanner breaking goto auto-stop feature
- Equip/unequip mount did not take AP



- Jerg move always in group bigger than 1
- BUG: turn number is not saved / loaded



- stop and/or prevent auto-move when energy low
- getting shot at should cancel goto
- Add stop message when doing goto ? (Ennemy ship entered scanner range, Ennemy ship too close, discovered planet, etc.)


- BUG: having more than one non-stackable item of the same type would screw up cargo
- BUG: Draging the camera while in look-around would cancel look-around
- BUG: Crashes, NULL and other crazyness still in leaderboard




- Menu button in HUD with "save and quit", "suicide" (eventually "options" too ?)
- BUG: Crashes because I insert NULL and list data in perm_save ?!?
- Quality of life : when clicking transfer all... if left ship has weapon and right ship has empty weapon... move to mount instead of cargo


- Review the fact that as you become powerful you will use more energy. Even if the weapons are more efficient, the ennemies will be harder to kill so how to you keep your energy needs in check ?
	- Homeworld planet should have higher chance of being colonized
	- Deeper planet could drop more Uranium
	- Deeper planet could have something even better than Uranium (or battleship might have bigger chance to drop unobtainium)
- Added shield mk2 & 3 (medium, large)
- Made rows a bit larger in converter for easier picking with finger
- Removed "description" in converter because it's just repeating the same informations
- Added background to modal HowMany dialog
- Increased damage profile of advanced weapons (mk2 & 3)
- Scanner mk2 reveals fully big bodies
- "unknown" marker's position are updated if object moves


- Refactor weapon system to work with multiple weapons
	- add "skip" button to weapon targetting overlay
	- add "cancel shots" button to targetting overlay
- Tweak: Probe couuld have a higher chance to drop scanner MK2 than other things in the game
- BUG: Number of visited solar system need to be saved and restored from save
- BUG: Ghost missile in inv when 0 missile
- BUG: Load and save num_generated_level for leaderboard score
- how_many dialog init to max value
- BUG: bad stackable!=true check in converter prevented converting multiple of the same type
- BUG: AI didn't use AP when missing shots
- up and down wormhole should have different sprite
- BUG: look around reveal hidden objects



- Add ability to spawn from scene template anywhere (not just level creation)
- BUG: wormhole shader doesn't do anything on my Tablet (updated godot to 3.1)
- Endgame :
	- spawn pre-generated modules (group of ennemies, specific planet with specific drop, etc.)
		- pre-generated modules might have special AI behavior :
			- group of ennemies should stick together until player is detected then go for the kill in their own way (pathfinding could be "goup" and one "group_leader" ?)
			- module bounding box... so we don't spawn stuff randomly outside bounds of the level
	- going up first wormhole check for win condition
	- improve scoring and leaderboard
- BUG: Auto-pilot can stay stuck if target is out of bounds
- highlight (like targetting overlay) the tile currently under the mouse
- BUG: when transfering between ship.... there seems to be some error in cargo volume calculation
- BUG: transfering converter of yendor to my inv makes my converter disapear


- BUG: Mouse stay stuck if moving camera when sub-menu is up
- BUG: Going down wormhole without scanner make the whole map visible ?
- BUG: changing level loads default_player instead of saved ship (multiple bugs on this one, some stupid, some less obvious)
- BUG: GOTO should not trigger (or cancel) if ship is over-weight


	- pinch zoom on device
- Implement consumable interface
	- UI
	- JSON
	- effects
- BUG: Crash if you mount nothing in mount window



- when ennemies miss the fx doesn't show (but the code is there)

- Reset Crafting lists when crafting done
- Make craft button craft more than one thing if enough items are in using list
- BUG: Touching myself in fast-travel sends me random location (ai was choosing a random destination because we were already there)
- can't craft ship with found body (scout ?) (frigging issue between "res://src" and "src")


- BUG: targetting overlay can stack when clicking weapon button multiple time (should pop HUD too maybe ?)
- BUG: weapon button missing when tranfering ship
- BUG: Transfering mounts duplicate cargo content ?!?




- BUG: Question mark pop up with ghost
- BUG: Changing mounts did not drop the item !
	- touch to goto and stop if something interesting enter sight
- New scanner :
	- Detects unknown large objects, displays them as ghost '?'
- Make energy be consumed per turn, not per move (so that we use energy even when we wait)


- prototype having more than one weapon mount (right now I assume mount points are both type and unique ids)
	- convert all mount to arrays ?
	- How to handle weapon mounts with different weapon equipped ? with different range and firing pattern ?
	- multiple shields. Should one shield empty then the other or both empty at the same rate ? what happen when one shield is bigger than another ?
	- can you stack the same utility ? (multiple solar arrays, multiple cargo compactor ?) (diminishing return ?)
	- should stacked shield also provide diminishing return ?
- Check Globals.total_turn - last_update is done after calculating stacking for all systems
- Refactor all inventory dialog to work with arrayed mounts
	- equip scene
	- jettison scene
	- transfer scene
	
	
- Welcome Screen

- BUG: changing ship should update converter button visibility (and maybe others ? wormhole ?)
- BUG: Dropping / removing scanner should update scanner behavior

- BUG: I can target myself !
- Ship transfer and crafting
- BUG: Destroying crafted ship is consired player and die ? (fixed itself with other fixes ?)
- BUG: issues with AP when switching ship

- Equipping objects duplicate them ! (mis-calling a signal (gotta be careful with parameters, it fail silently))
- Shields ?
	- no health regen... but implement shield that DO regen (at the cost of energy ?)
	- Use Matter-Energy converter to produce energy
		- Spawn items from destoyed ships
	- save and restore modified attributes

	- Shoot back
- Mersenne Twister
- BUG: don't consume energy or AP before knowing if we have enough ammo !
- BUG: when 0 missile in inventory, still shows Missile (but not "1 x" ***) (problem with data being : "data/json/..." and src being : "res://data/json/...")
- BUG: laser still use missiles ? (forgot to remove ammo from json)
	- Add lasers (shoot in straight line (left-right-up-down), do not use ammo, use more energy per shot)
	- Limit grid to weapon range
	- Death if no hull or energy
	- energy to matter converter
		- design (crafting system ? simple change hydrogen into energy?)
		- implement new UI for crafting
	- Update hull and energy in status bar
- Start Menu
- Result screen on death
- Make converter button invisible if no converter equiped
- Equip items
- Die when 0 energy or 0 hull
- Position of player ship when going up/down wormholes (In the end I just have an enum. Hackish but couldn't figure out a better way)
	- Maybe need to pass some "origin" parameter
		- origin is null, player should be on top wormhole
		- origin is X,Y, put player at XY
- Memory / scanner issues when going up & down levels (scanner reference deleted objects ? yet it should be clearing it's list when an object is deleted... need investigating)
- Starting wormhole is invisible because of memory... why ?
- FoW (Fog of War)
	- "remembered" sprite appearance
	- Not visible sprite
	- Fog of War "look"
- Memory system :
	- Desaturation shader for sprites
	- Pass modified_attributes init param to CreateNode() method
	- add a "memory" attribute with "reference_unique_id" and "saturation_value"
	- have either MemoryBehavior or SpriteBehavior (or both together) create the sprite then set the saturation in the shader
- Load and Save
- Fixed data for wormholes



- Run on Android
- message log when passing over an object
- fix cargo hold storage volume check with base_attributes & modifed_attributes
- Drop
	- Display inventory
		- Display volume used / volume capacity
		- Dialog ok/cancel buttons
		- Decide on the way to do selection
