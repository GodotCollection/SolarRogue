ROAD TO ALPHA :::
- End screen when leaving top wormhole
	- Confirmation message
	- Success ("You are rich") / failure ("You can't leave yet")
	- Final scoring
- Generate Level data :
	- 12 "Main" levels
		- 1 "Special" level with Converter of Yendor
	- 3 Branches (for now, 3 level each ? 2 filler & 1 "special")
		- Human Fortress
			- Last level should be peaceful and contains a bunch of shop.
		- Jerg Homeworld
			- Last level contain a "Queen" boss that spawns ennemies (Queen could drop some garantied artifact ?)
		- Vorg Homeworld
			- Last level contains a "Titan" "Cube" boss and lots of loot ?
	- Equipment (see excel)
		- Code Feature
		- Add item to JSON
		- Add to spawn list everywhere !
	- Ships
		- Human (Basic)
			- Art
			- Stats
			- JSON
		- Jerg (Swarm, no shield, big hull, fast)
			- Art
			- Stats
			- JSON
		- Vorg (Big shield, effect weapon (disable ship equipment, poison like effects, slow down, etc.)
			- Art
			- Stats
			- JSON
		- Random Unique boss
			- Death Star ?
				- Art
				- Stats
				- JSON


TODO :::
- New scanner :
	- Detects unknown large objects, displays them as ghost '?'
- up and down wormhole should have different sprite
- Implement consumable interface
	- UI
	- JSON
	- effects
- transfer drag&drop dialog. Should ask for how many of a stack to transfer
- Refactor weapon system to work with multiple weapons
	- add "skip" button to weapon targetting overlay
	- add "cancel shots" button to targetting overlay
- BUG: can't fire multiple weapon if we select a target out of range (works if we select empty tiles)
- Refactor equip mount dialog with similar drag&drop instead of two annoying separate popup
- BUG: Mouse stay stuck if moving camera when sub-menu is up
- level generation improvement :
	- have the spawn chance be able to have group of related elements (so I can spawn for example, 3 missiles next to each other 0.1% chance per level)
		- make for more story like spawns like a missile launcher and 2-3 missile and maybe a broken down prop next to each other but relative position instead of absolute like the sun
	- revisit spawn chance... could I specify it in chance per level instead of per tile ? would make tweaking level design easier (1 per level is a chance of 0,00015625 !)
	- Sokoban example : might want to spawn wormhole #1 OR #2.. not both, but definitly at least 1
	- Nethack : Quest level different by race (I don't have race for now ?)
	- Dependency ? Castle can spawn between 25-29 but never before medusa
- clean name (always return the id with or without "res:")
- how to do "global max" ? branch1 should be spawned only once, per game, not per map, some items might be unique too, if they've been spawned, they should never appear again
- Message if you try to go up the home wormhole
- Save after each turn
- make sure player cannot generate more energy than max capacity
- Tweak: Probe doesn't have enough cargo space to hold any hulls for crafting which means we can be stuck in a probe forever ?
- fix max cargo. make sure we're never above cargo capacity
	- check if we always update current cargo volume
- review multi-tile objects
	- Collision on each tile but behave as a single entity ?
- Transfering ship & ship item should take AP
- BUG: Any random interaction should cancel targetting ?
- Spawning
- re-work Object identification (show as unknown, then remember id-ed stuff)
- Basic interaction
	- Look around
		- select item using keyboard
	- Shoot
		- select target using keyboard
	- Scan
		- Give health remaining on ships
		- Give detailed description of planet (rich but hard to mine, poor but easy to mine, etc)
- Two places where I access cargo content and just do -= 1. or .remove()... but if the result returned was in BaseAttribute that's dangerous

- check if assigning array or dictionary copy or reference content in godot
- Ability to swap tileset for ascii somehow
- Look & feel
	- Icons :
		- Converter
		- Hydrogen
		- Scanner
		- Shield
		- Laser turret
		- Missile Launcher
		- Ship parts ?
- GUI
	- Status
	- Log window
	- Buttons
	- Layouts
		- modal windows ?
		- Hiding control when asking question ?

	
	
	
polish :::
- Tweak: Should be able to hold hulls for crafting scout in scout (at least if drop everything)
- Crafting interface
	- Automatically check item necessary for recipe (if possible)
	- Mark missing item in red in description
- Loot interface :
	- Move all cargo button shouldn't affect mounts, there should be a move all mounts button that moves only mounts that fit free spots
	- when drag & dropping.. highlight mount slot that fit with the object being draged
- block button shortcuts when dialog is open
- Generic system to show/hide button based on player inv/equippement
- Cache JSONs when loaded 
	- so I stop getting it from disk everytime I need the attributes of an equiped object,
	- base_attributes could also be changed to point to the cached data to avoid duplication
- Change FTL button to say > or < depending on wormhole data
- When dead FTL button stays invisible ?
- Drag-cancel as % of screen resolution
- smooth camera (a la township?)
	- smooth zoom limits & exponential zoom
	- drag still remember even tough camera doesn't pass limit

- Improve data system
	- overrides (modifed_attributes)
	
- Read-Only base_attributes to prevent un-savable changes by mistake
	
- Godot : Implement Localization
	- You can link CSVs in localization, replace certain resources (like textures) with others and even change the project name based on choosen locale
	- CSVs file are automatically converted into localization files
		- use tr() method to get translation from keyboard
		- button labels and such automatically check if text is a key and translate
		- for format godot support stuff like "bleh {id}".format({"id":"hello world"})\
		
IDEAS:::
- If you try to produce energy over the maximum of the ship capacity there is a chance you "choke" (engine goes critical and blow up)
	
	
DONE :::
- Make energy be consumed per turn, not per move (so that we use energy even when we wait)


- prototype having more than one weapon mount (right now I assume mount points are both type and unique ids)
	- convert all mount to arrays ?
	- How to handle weapon mounts with different weapon equipped ? with different range and firing pattern ?
	- multiple shields. Should one shield empty then the other or both empty at the same rate ? what happen when one shield is bigger than another ?
	- can you stack the same utility ? (multiple solar arrays, multiple cargo compactor ?) (diminishing return ?)
	- should stacked shield also provide diminishing return ?
- Check Globals.total_turn - last_update is done after calculating stacking for all systems
- Refactor all inventory dialog to work with arrayed mounts
	- equip scene
	- jettison scene
	- transfer scene
	
	
- Welcome Screen
- transfer window need to update cargo.
- ship cannot move if over cargo



- same-tile multi-target selection dialog
- Tweak: Probe should have higher chance to drop something usefull (at least 2 hydrogen)... or it's not worth wasting a missile on them
- BUG: Crash when trying to fire when no weapon equipped
- Targetting display twice in the middle right quadrant
- BUG: Shuttle is pointing wrong way
- BUG: Missing 
		"equip_ap":3.0,
		"unequip_ap":3.0 for various obj (laser, missile_launcher... ?)
- Memory should be copied over to new ship ?
	- Ability to drop cargo if other cargo is empty
- BUG: Weird interaction when camera bump limit


- Transfering item should go through inventory system ?
- BUG: Hydrogen can spawn outside the map from planet
- Work on loot interface
	- Save changes on "ok" pressed
- Camera should not move when using dialog
- BUG: changing ship should update converter button visibility (and maybe others ? wormhole ?)
- BUG: Dropping / removing scanner should update scanner behavior
- BUG: ran out of energy with 3 000 to spare after playing for a while ? (when shields where full and you got hit, you used all energy since last time you were hit)
- BUG: I can target myself !
- Ship transfer and crafting
- BUG: Destroying crafted ship is consired player and die ? (fixed itself with other fixes ?)
- BUG: issues with AP when switching ship
- Probe hull is not consumed when making ships
- Animation !
- Make energy work
	- Assign energy for actions
	- Use energy when doing actions
	- Look around
- "more" button with a list of less common actions (look around, equip/unequip, etc.)
- Equipping objects duplicate them ! (mis-calling a signal (gotta be careful with parameters, it fail silently))
- Shields ?
	- no health regen... but implement shield that DO regen (at the cost of energy ?)
	- Use Matter-Energy converter to produce energy
		- Spawn items from destoyed ships
	- save and restore modified attributes
- Basic AI
	- Shoot back
- Mersenne Twister
- BUG: don't consume energy or AP before knowing if we have enough ammo !
- BUG: when 0 missile in inventory, still shows Missile (but not "1 x" ***) (problem with data being : "data/json/..." and src being : "res://data/json/...")
- BUG: laser still use missiles ? (forgot to remove ammo from json)
	- Add lasers (shoot in straight line (left-right-up-down), do not use ammo, use more energy per shot)
	- Limit grid to weapon range
	- Death if no hull or energy
	- energy to matter converter
		- design (crafting system ? simple change hydrogen into energy?)
		- implement new UI for crafting
	- Update hull and energy in status bar
- Start Menu
- Result screen on death
- Make converter button invisible if no converter equiped
- Equip items
- Die when 0 energy or 0 hull
- Position of player ship when going up/down wormholes (In the end I just have an enum. Hackish but couldn't figure out a better way)
	- Maybe need to pass some "origin" parameter
		- origin is null, player should be on top wormhole
		- origin is X,Y, put player at XY
- Memory / scanner issues when going up & down levels (scanner reference deleted objects ? yet it should be clearing it's list when an object is deleted... need investigating)
- Starting wormhole is invisible because of memory... why ?
- FoW (Fog of War)
	- "remembered" sprite appearance
	- Not visible sprite
	- Fog of War "look"
- Memory system :
	- Desaturation shader for sprites
	- Pass modified_attributes init param to CreateNode() method
	- add a "memory" attribute with "reference_unique_id" and "saturation_value"
	- have either MemoryBehavior or SpriteBehavior (or both together) create the sprite then set the saturation in the shader
- Load and Save
- Fixed data for wormholes



- Run on Android
- message log when passing over an object
- fix cargo hold storage volume check with base_attributes & modifed_attributes
- Drop
	- Display inventory
		- Display volume used / volume capacity
		- Dialog ok/cancel buttons
		- Decide on the way to do selection


- Pickup
- Destroy other ships
- Spawn resource from planet
		
		
- (AI)Ship move
- Random planet
- Random ships (at least 2 types)
- Data System
- Move around using touch control & keyboard
