1st step :::
- fix cargo hold storage volume check with base_attributes & modifed_attributes
- Generate Object using RNG :
	- Wormholes (up & down)
- Ability to swap tileset for ascii somehow
- Basic interaction
	- Shoot
		- select target using keyboard
		- Use energy when shooting
		- Spawn items from destoyed ships

DONE :::
- Pickup
