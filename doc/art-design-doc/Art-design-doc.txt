----- QUESTION FOR HIRE -------
- How long would it take for the sprite sheet ?
- Can we agree on a certain number of revision ?
- I will credit you in the game and you can use the art in your portefolio but it would be for my exclusive commercial use
  and I can do what I want with it for the purpose of my game and any derivative. Is that ok with you ?
- How much for the whole sprite sheet
- How would you like to be paid ?


- Pixel art
- Inspired by traditional ascii rogue game
	- Nethack
	- Dwarf fortress
- Beautiful mix of pixel art & ascii in cogmind menus and look&feel :
	- https://youtu.be/Cki73qtA32w?t=583
	- the green, glitching ascii effect, simple tile pixel art, etc.
	- https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2015/03/tileset-1-0/
	
- Features :
	- Sci-fi ship flying through empty space in solar systems randomly generated ennemy ships, planets, suns, space stations, etc.
	  Take wormhole to reach final system and ?
	- Tactical Turn Based
		- Probably a lot of time spent in menus / inventory, etc.
	- Fog of War
		- Player can equip some scanner on their ship that will allow them to see more-less far
		- Some kind of "remembered" view of were planets/ships/items where (but could have moved if outside of the Fog of War)
			- In most other roguelike game you see a grayed-out version of the level but my levels will be mostly empty space so how do player know where they've been ?
			- Was thinking of hiding a detailed background and reveal it only for where the player has been but it should not interfere with the foreground (maybe different color ?)
	- 2D tile based
		- Tiles can be any size (right now 128x128) but it's a square 2D grid top-view
		- "some" items could take more than one square (the sun in my example)
	- want to keep in mind multiple platform.
		- Touch & keyboard friendly
		- Smaller and larger screen
		- Not against having a completly different UI for mobile & PC (keyboard shortcut based on PC and touch based on device)
