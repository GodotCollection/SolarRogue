- Run on Android
- GUI
	- Status
	- Log window

- FoW (Fog of War)
	- "remembered" sprite appearance

- smooth camera (a la township?)
	- smooth zoom limits & exponential zoom
	- drag still remember even tough camera doesn't pass limit

- Improve data system
	- overrides (modifed_attributes)
	- save and restore modified attributes

- (AI)Ship move
- Random planet
