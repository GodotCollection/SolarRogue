1st step :

- Generate Object using RNG :
	- Random planet
	- Random ships (at least 2 types)
	- Wormholes (up & down)
- Ability to swap tileset for ascii somehow
- Data System
- Move around using touch control & keyboard
- Basic interaction
	- Shoot
		- Destroy other ships
		- Spawn resource from planet
	- Pickup
	- Drop
	- Scan
		- Give health remaining on ships
		- Give detailed description of planet (rich but hard to mine, poor but easy to mine, etc)
	- Use Matter-Energy converter to produce energy
- Basic AI
	- Ship move
	- Shoot back or run away if shot
- Run on Android
- Log window ?

polish :
- smooth camera (a la township?)
	- smooth zoom limits & exponential zoom
	- drag still remember even tough camera doesn't pass limit
