Hi, I'm a Solo Game Developer and I'm Looking for a pixel artist for a 2D top-down space exploration roguelike. Right now the game tiles are 128x128 but the sprites could be anywhere between 64x64 to 384x384 (for the sun).

I need 10 ships split in 3 different races. Between 4 and 8 planets and a bunch of items that the player can pick up.

I have a let's play video to show the game's curent state : https://youtu.be/wiIFraCAixI

I like this style https://www.deviantart.com/pixel-pax/art/Spaceships-60-98272278
Or these kind of items : http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/61876.htm

I'm open to other design. My budget is around 500$. If you're Canadian I can do bank transfer or Paypal.
