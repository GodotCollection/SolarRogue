--- Pixel art ---
[PAID] 
Hi, I'm Ombarus a Solo Game Developer and I'm Looking for a pixel artist for a 2D top-down space exploration roguelike. Right now sprites are 128x128. Contact me at ombarus.dev@gmail.com with your rates and portfolio.

This is the current sprite sheet with temporary art. I Need someone to unify the design and establish a style.

Some of the styles that caught my eyes, but I'm open to other style too.

Ships

Planets

Items

As the game progress there will be more sprite to add so there could be more opportunity to work together.

--- Design UX ---
[PAID] Looking for a UX and UI artist that could provide some concept UI design for my 2D top-down space exploration roguelike. I want something that reminds the player of the terminal/ascii era of roguelike while using modern graphic techniques, animation and tools. 

My current look is a mix between sprites and console font text
