Feature :
- dynamically generated spacy background that act as FoW
- Spawning :
	- (near)Empty level should be repopulated after some time
- Turn / Action based
	- Actions can take more or less than a turn
		- ? Every Action has a AP cost, Each action increase total AP spent. Whoever has spent the less AP is next to move.
		- could some action start and be changed before they finish ? (guided missile, etc ?)
- Story ?
	- Earth is in peril ! Find the last tech to save it !
	- Explore the center of the galaxy to bring back it's wonders !
	- 
- Energy is Life
	- 0 Energy means death
	- Actions cost energy
	- Energy as currency ?
	- Matter-Energy converter allow you to create stuff using energy
	- Matter-Energy converter allow you to destroy things to get back energy
- Hull strength
- Harvesting ressources from planet & dead enemy ship
- Ship Equipment :
	- Engine (move speed)
	- Weapon (laser, missile, Lance ???)
	- Truster ? (Dodge)
	- Shields
	- Scanner
	- Cloaking
- Display :
	- Console Message
	- Action Buttons
	- Ship Status Bar
	- Inventory / Equip
- Level-up or item only ?
	- Level up could 
		- Increase weapon accuracy, dodge
		- Should not increase arbitrary ship components like hull HP, or shield strenght or # of hardpoint mounts.
		- Unless there's some reason, like construction of hardmount point 2 is completed !
	- Item only :
		- Hard to explain weapon accuracy increase...
		- Hull increase can only be achieved by switching ships ?
- Swap ship with salavage ?
	- I like the idea, not sure how to implement it mechanically
	- Damaged ship without destroying it (>1% health) can be borded ?
		- Destoyed ship could randomly drop a "carcass"
		- Ships could be found in special area (derelic shipyard, abandonned ship, etc)
	- Bording ships has (or not) a % of failure
	- Your matter-to-energy converter can create a new ship based on some blueprints
		- Use HUGE amount of energy
		- You need to have scanned and/or destroyed enough ennemy for your ship's AI to be able to recopy it
			- Prevents you from being able to copy unique ship that might be too powerful, unless you have some special scanner/ship/item equiped ?
			- Energy cost means trade-off.
- Chained Action (wait x turn, go to x,y)
	- take multiple basic actions
	- can be interupted
	- can be resumed ?
