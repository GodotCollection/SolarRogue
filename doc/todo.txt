1st step :::
- Make converter button invisible if no converter equiped
- Make energy work
	- Update hull and energy in status bar
	- energy to matter converter
		- design (crafting system ? simple change hydrogen into energy?)
		- implement new UI for crafting
	- Assign energy for actions
	- Use energy when doing actions
	- Death if no hull or energy
- Equip items
- check if assigning array or dictionary copy or reference content in godot
- Godot : Investigate Localization tab
	- You can link CSVs in localization, replace certain resources (like textures) with others and even change the project name based on choosen locale
	- CSVs file are automatically converted into localization files
		- use tr() method to get translation from keyboard
		- button labels and such automatically check if text is a key and translate
		- for format godot support stuff like "bleh {id}".format({"id":"hello world"})
- Ability to swap tileset for ascii somehow
- Basic interaction
	- Shoot
		- select target using keyboard
		- Use energy when shooting
		- Spawn items from destoyed ships
	- Scan
		- Give health remaining on ships
		- Give detailed description of planet (rich but hard to mine, poor but easy to mine, etc)
	- Use Matter-Energy converter to produce energy
- Basic AI
	- Shoot back
- GUI
	- Status
	- Log window
	- Buttons
	- Layouts
		- modal windows ?
		- Hiding control when asking question ?

	
	
	
polish :::
- Drag-cancel as % of screen resolution
- smooth camera (a la township?)
	- smooth zoom limits & exponential zoom
	- drag still remember even tough camera doesn't pass limit

- Improve data system
	- overrides (modifed_attributes)
	- save and restore modified attributes
	
- Read-Only base_attributes to prevent un-savable changes by mistake
	

	
	
	
DONE :::
- Position of player ship when going up/down wormholes (In the end I just have an enum. Hackish but couldn't figure out a better way)
	- Maybe need to pass some "origin" parameter
		- origin is null, player should be on top wormhole
		- origin is X,Y, put player at XY
- Memory / scanner issues when going up & down levels (scanner reference deleted objects ? yet it should be clearing it's list when an object is deleted... need investigating)
- Starting wormhole is invisible because of memory... why ?
- FoW (Fog of War)
	- "remembered" sprite appearance
	- Not visible sprite
	- Fog of War "look"
- Memory system :
	- Desaturation shader for sprites
	- Pass modified_attributes init param to CreateNode() method
	- add a "memory" attribute with "reference_unique_id" and "saturation_value"
	- have either MemoryBehavior or SpriteBehavior (or both together) create the sprite then set the saturation in the shader
- Load and Save
- Fixed data for wormholes



- Run on Android
- message log when passing over an object
- fix cargo hold storage volume check with base_attributes & modifed_attributes
- Drop
	- Display inventory
		- Display volume used / volume capacity
		- Dialog ok/cancel buttons
		- Decide on the way to do selection


- Pickup
- Destroy other ships
- Spawn resource from planet
		
		
- (AI)Ship move
- Random planet
- Random ships (at least 2 types)
- Data System
- Move around using touch control & keyboard
